## Terraform workspace and multiple environments



**How to Manage Multiple Environments with Terraform?**



When Terraform deploys resources, it stores metadata to track the resources in a state file. So if we want to deploy resources for multiple environments such as production/QA/Staging, we need to differentiate deployment actions and state files as well. However with Terraform workspaces and Reusable modules architecture we can achieve separate environment provisioning.



1. **Terraform Workspaces**- Terraform Workspaces allows us to manage separate state files for each workspace in the provided backend from a single source of configuration files

2. **Reusable Modules**- In this architecture, configuration files are stored inside a single directory. With module block we can source that directory and pass the variables.
